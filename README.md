# PredictionMarket DApp

## Project Description

PredictionMarket is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to create and participate in prediction markets. Users can create markets around future events, place bets on outcomes, and earn rewards based on the accuracy of their predictions. The platform leverages smart contracts to ensure transparent, trustless, and automated settlement of prediction markets.

The smart contract handles the entire lifecycle of prediction markets - from creation and betting to resolution and payout distribution. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing complete transparency and eliminating the need for intermediaries.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize prediction markets by creating a decentralized platform where anyone can create markets about future events and participate in collective intelligence gathering. We aim to harness the wisdom of crowds to make better predictions about everything from sports outcomes and election results to cryptocurrency prices and weather patterns.

By removing centralized control and reducing barriers to entry, we envision a future where prediction markets become a powerful tool for information aggregation, risk management, and decision-making across various industries and communities.
